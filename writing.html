        and sure, we're close, yet compartmentalized within our own lives. <br>
        there may be slight <br>
        overlaps, <br>
        I'm on the swim team with one person and have the same mathematics teacher as another, <br>
        but as far as futures are concerned we <br>
        really <br>
        aren't <br>
        together. <br>
        we don't ask recommendations for college counselors. <br>
        we don't ask one another <br>
        where we're taking tutoring or makeup classes, <br>
        what kind of extracurriculars we're doing, <br>
        what exceptional events have happened along our way. <br>
        we ask each other for advice on life decisions, <br>
        but <br>
        we'd rarely take up that advice. <br>
        we'd never discuss our lives as soon as futures are involved, <br>
        and why? <br>
        are we <br>
        scared of the future, <br>
        scared of the thought that it and time will unravel us, pulling us to opposite sides of the globe? <br>
        scared of the thought that someone else will be more successful than ourselves, or the opposite, that we'll hurt someone close in being showy of our own successes?<br>
